## General info
Going shopping with my girlfriend we had a **problem with the shopping list** - everyone had their own list to which they added products, and before shopping we shared our lists with each other. Just sharing the list was **inconvenient, on top of that some products were repeated**. Therefore, I came up with the idea of writing an app that would simplify certain processes and **solve the above problems**. This is how the idea for the ‚ÄúShopping List App‚Äù was born.

Just **sharing the list** with others allows you to easily and quickly **check what you are missing** when, for example, you stop by the store on your way home from work.

Products are assigned to **categories** - products of the same category are **automatically placed next to each other** in the list, avoiding walking around the store.

The application's interface and some of its functionalities were inspired by the ‚ÄúListonic‚Äù application
