## General info
Going shopping with my girlfriend we had a **problem with the shopping list** - everyone had their own list to which they added products, and before shopping we shared our lists with each other. Just sharing the list was **inconvenient, on top of that some products were repeated**. Therefore, I came up with the idea of writing an app that would simplify certain processes and **solve the above problems**. This is how the idea for the “Shopping List App” was born.

**Sharing the list** with others allows you to easily and quickly **check what you are missing** when, for example, you stop by the store on your way home from work. Or when you are together in the store, you can split to get different products.

Products are assigned to **categories** - products of the same category are **automatically placed next to each other** in the list, avoiding walking back and forth across the store.

The application's interface and some of its functionalities were inspired by the “Listonic” application
